# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The AI Job Application Assistant is a platform that helps job seekers create optimized job applications through AI-enhanced manual processes. Users create accounts, build comprehensive data repositories from social media profiles and documents, then manually input job details to receive AI-generated resumes and cover letters tailored to specific job postings. The platform includes company research automation, ATS scoring, refinement tools, and project recommendations to maximize interview chances while maintaining full user control over the application process.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

3. WHEN a user uploads documents (base resume, recommendation letters, project descriptions) THEN the system SHALL parse and store this information in their repository using knowledge graph structures
4. WHEN the user repository is populated THEN CrewAI agents SHALL analyze the data and recommend baseline improvements to strengthen the user's profile

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a job seeker, I want to manually input job details and have the system automatically research the company, so that CrewAI agents can access rich contextual data for application optimization without violating any terms of service.

4. WHEN company research is available THEN CrewAI agents SHALL generate a personalized cover letter using user repository data, company repository information, and current events

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a job seeker, I want to review and refine my generated resume and cover letter, so that I can ensure the application meets my standards and preferences before manually submitting it myself.

2. WHEN skill gaps are identified THEN CrewAI agents SHALL recommend specific projects tailored to the company and job description to maximize the user's competitiveness
3. WHEN project recommendations are provided THEN the system SHALL include detailed implementation guidance, expected timeline, and how each project addresses job requirements
4. WHEN a user completes a recommended project THEN the system SHALL help them document and integrate it into their data repository with updated knowledge graph connections

### Requirement 6
